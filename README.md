# Microchallenge-II


# grey is the new green

Designed and made as part of the second challenge in the IAAC Master in Design for Emergent Futures course "Digital Prototyping for Design", this project is an exploration of the aesthetic and practical possibilities of reusing greywater in an urban environment.

## the idea

Our group ([Ramiro](linktosite), [Korbi](linktosite), and [Cagsun](linktosite)) are interested in anthropocene water scarcity and regenerative adaptations to it, such as reducing water usage, reusing water, urban horticulture, etc. 

This project is an assembling of various approaches to these topics, and includes a practical and a more communication-oriented aspects.

It is composed of three main parts:

1) a lipid trap, where greywater can be poured (for example from a bucket used to clean the floor). The trap will seperate lipids and water soluble components

2) a plant filtering tube, where aquatic plants grow and filter out further components of the water

3) a vortex (a turbulent shape made by water due to a magnetic motion powered by a motor). This oxiginates the water, and serves as a visual celebration of the substance

(potentially, a hydroponic setup will be added to this)

This system is housed in a CNC milled structure. Together, the parts form an initial filtering system which could be used to grow things in a domestic environment while showcasing water and it's sometimes hidden but central role in our lives (and for life in general).

## what we did

We had already built a basic lipid trap.

For the vortex, we went through a period of brainstorming and making design choices. First, we planned on making it

## Things we are missing for the dialogues II:

VORTEX:
- Try sphere (fishbowl) for vortex system
  - (Ça) Cool, up for testing this. 
- Add leds as candle or some nice effect
  - (Ça) We can test. We'd need to design a base for holding the LEDs.
- Try starting the vortex with some arduino code for automation
  - (Ça) I can prep the circuit and code for this so we test on Tuesday. 
- Model and 3d print piece to grab magnets attached to motor
  - (Ça) I think this is the most important one. Ramiro could you design a piece for the motor, and possibly a piece to hold the magnets (so that it's softer and rotates more easily) 

FILTERING PLANTS:
- Cut pipe and make holes for plants
  - (Ça) We can do on Tuesday?
- Add manual valve "" on side for water go to vortex
  - (Ça) I can bring a valve, we can try fitting it. But it's white (and not so pretty). 
- Add valve for water to go from lipid trap to plants pipe
  - (Ça) For this, we'd need the pump, no?

LIPID TRAP:
- Take old water and store greywater(our houses or IAAC cleaning) for live test on wednesday
  - (Ça) Shall we make the Lipid trap more pretty by cleaning it from the markings from last time, and clearly show the water flow?
  - (Ça) We can use water from school I guess?
- Put mesh for solids at the beginning of the trap
  - (Ça) Good idea
- Put pump and connect it to plants pipe
  - (Ok, this can also be controlled by Arduino  

EXTRAS:

- Ive made some sketches on how might look a new look for this system we created, ill show it to you and if you like it (and we define it together) maybe I can model it end of tuesday and make some render to show it on wednesday as improve for the prototype we have.
  - Cool   
- Presentation things? i dont know if we should make some posters or something as the previous dialogue. It would be good to define what we want to show of information apart from the prototype (printings, etc).
  - I'm not sure if we need to print anything that explains this project better than the demo. Maybe we can place a computer next to it to show our repo, other references, etc. if needed?
