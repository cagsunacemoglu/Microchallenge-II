# Microchallenge-II


# grey is the new green

Designed and made as part of the second challenge in the IAAC Master in Design for Emergent Futures course "Digital Prototyping for Design", this project is an exploration of the aesthetic and practical possibilities of reusing greywater in an urban environment.

## the idea

Our group ([Ramiro](linktosite), [Korbi](linktosite), and [Cagsun](linktosite)) are interested in anthropocene water scarcity and regenerative adaptations to it, such as reducing water usage, reusing water, urban horticulture, etc. 

This project is an assembling of various approaches to these topics, and includes a practical and a more communication-oriented aspects.

It is composed of three main parts:

1) a lipid trap, where greywater can be poured (for example from a bucket used to clean the floor). The trap will seperate lipids and water soluble components

2) a plant filtering tube, where aquatic plants grow and filter out further components of the water

3) a vortex (a turbulent shape made by water due to a magnetic motion powered by a motor). This oxiginates the water, and serves as a visual celebration of the substance

(potentially, a hydroponic setup will be added to this)

This system is housed in a CNC milled structure. Together, the parts form an initial filtering system which could be used to grow things in a domestic environment while showcasing water and it's sometimes hidden but central role in our lives (and for life in general).

## what we did

We had already built a basic lipid trap.

For the vortex, we went through a period of brainstorming and making design choices. First, we planned on making it
